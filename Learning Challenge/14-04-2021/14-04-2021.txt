# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to:
1) Import the required package
2) Create and use tensors
3) Use GPU acceleration
4) Demonstrate tf.data.Dataset
- The Keras functional API is a way to create models that are more flexible than the tf.keras.Sequential API. 
- The functional API can handle models with non-linear topology, shared layers, and even multiple inputs or outputs.
- The main idea is that a deep learning model is usually a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of layers. 
- So the functional API is a way to build graphs of layers.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

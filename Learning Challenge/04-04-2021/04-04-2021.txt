# Learning Updates:
- I learnt how to use the keras tuner to tune hyperparameters for a model 
- The keras tuner is a library that helps you pick the optimalk set of hyper parameters for your tensorflow program
- The process of selecting the right set of hyperparameters for your machine learning (ML) application is called hyperparameter tuning or hypertuning.
- Hyperparameters are the variables that govern the training process and the topology of an ML model. 
- These variables remain constant over the training process and directly impact the performance of your ML program.
- Hyperparameters are of two types:

   = Model hyperparameters - Influence model selection such as the number and width of hidden layers
   = Algorithm hyperparameters - Influence the speed and quality of the learning algorithm such as the learning rate for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the number of nearest neighbors for a k Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:

- Learnt about Tensorflow 2 amd the multiple changes that have been made.
- Tensorflow 2 has has made Tensorflow users more productive by:
    = removing redundant APIs, 
    = making APIs more consistent 
    = integrating new features like Eager Execution.
    = eliminitaing the global namespaces mechanism in favour of the default mechanism, i.e., if you lose track of a variable, it gets garbage collected.
    = replacing functions with sessions, thus allowing Tensorflow 2.0 to gain all the benefirst of the graph mode, such as better portability and performance.

- Learnt about basic Image Classification in Mahcine Learning using Tensorflow and Keras.
- Built and trained a model using the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify multiple classes of apparel.
- Also Learnt about Data preprocessing and how to test the model and evaluate it.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to compose one image in the style of another image using a technique called Neural Style Transfer
- Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
- This is implemented by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. 
- These statistics are extracted from the images using a convolutional network.
- DeepDream is an experiment that visualizes the patterns learned by a neural network. 
- Similar to when a child watches clouds and tries to interpret random shapes, DeepDream over-interprets and enhances the patterns it sees in an image.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

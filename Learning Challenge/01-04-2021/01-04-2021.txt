Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 3
===============================================

# Learning Updates:

- Learnt about TensorFlow's eager execution feature.
- Eager Execution is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs.
- It provides the user with multiple features such as:
    = An intuitive interface
    = Easier Debugging
    = Natural control flow.
- A major benefit of eager execution is that all the functionality of the host language is available while your model is executing.
- Also Learnt about basic regression. 
- In regression, the aim is to make predictions based on a pattern of continous values.
- We looked into different methods of training a model for regression, to get the best possible results.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images. 
- Since the Keras Sequential API is used, creating and training our model takes just a few lines of code.
- Transfer learning consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. 
- For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify tanukis.
- Fine-tuning, consists of unfreezing the entire model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training it on the new data with a very low learning rate. 
- This can potentially achieve meaningful improvements, by incrementally adapting the pretrained features to the new data.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:

- Learnt about Tensors. 
- Tensors are essentially multi-dimentional arrays with a uniform type. 
- They are what you would call matrices in math.
- All tensors are immutable in nature. Tensors cant be updated.
- There are 2 types of Tensors:
    = Ragged Tensors
    = Sparse Tensors.
- In Ragged Tensors, the number of elements along some axis varies.
- In Sparse Tensors, your data is sparse, like a very wide embedding space.
- Also Learnt about Overfitting and Underfitting and built a basic model to demonstrate them.

# Looking forward to Learning more!

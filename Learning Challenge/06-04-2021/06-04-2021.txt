Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 9
===============================================

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to use CSV data with tensorflow
- There are 2 steps to load CSV data:
    = Loading the data off the disk
    = Pre-processing the data into a form suitable for training
- Built and trained a model to demonstrate it.
- The simplest way to train a TensorFlow model on a small CSV dataset  is to load it into memory as a pandas Dataframe or a NumPy array.
- The abalone dataset is a good example of a small dataset, so used it for training.
- Also learnt how to define, save and restore a model.
- A model is basically a function that computes something on tensors
- It contains variables that can be updated on training.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

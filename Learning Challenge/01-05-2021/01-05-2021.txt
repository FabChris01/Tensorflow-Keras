# Learning Updates:
- Word2Vec is not a singular algorithm, rather, it is a family of model architectures and optimizations.
- These can be used to learn word embeddings from large datasets. 
- Embeddings learned through Word2Vec have proven to be successful on a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks.
- The phrase "Saving a TensorFlow model" typically means one of two things:
1) Checkpoints: They capture the exact value of all parameters (tf.Variable objects) used by a model.
2) The SavedModel format: This on the other hand includes a serialized description of the computation defined by the model in addition to the parameter values (checkpoint).


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- Used machine learning to categorize Iris flowers by species. I
- Also used TensorFlow to:
1) Build a model,
2) Train this model on example data, and
3) Use the model to make predictions about unknown data.
- One of the central abstraction in Keras is the Layer class. 
- A layer encapsulates both a state (the layer's "weights") and a transformation from inputs to outputs (a "call", the layer's forward pass).


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to load pandas dataframes into a tf.data.Dataset.
- Built and trained a model to demonstrate this using a small dataset provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease.
- This dataset contains several hundred rows in CSV format.
- Each row describes a patient, and each column describes an attribute.
- The model was trained on this information to predict whether a patient has heart disease, 
- This is a binary classification task in this dataset.
- We also focused on the less common features of the tf.GradientTape api in automatic differentiation.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

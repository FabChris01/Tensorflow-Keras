# Learning Updates:
- Learnt about data augmentation. Data Augmentation is a technique to increase the diversity of your training set by applying random (but realistic) transformations such as image rotation. 
- Also learnt how to apply data augmentation in two ways - Keras Preprocessing Layers and tf.image.
- The tf.data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. 
- For example, the pipeline for an image model might aggregate data from files in a distributed file system, apply random perturbations to each image, and merge randomly selected images into a batch for training. 
- The pipeline for a text model might involve extracting symbols from raw text data, converting them to embedding identifiers with a lookup table, and batching together sequences of different lengths. 
- The tf.data API makes it possible to handle large amounts of data, read from different data formats, and perform complex transformations.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

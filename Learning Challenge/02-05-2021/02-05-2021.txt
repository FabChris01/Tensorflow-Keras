# Learning Updates:
- Trained a recurrent neural network on the IMDB large movie review dataset for sentiment analysis.
- The IMDB large movie review dataset is a binary classification datasetâ€”all the reviews have either a positive or negative sentiment.
- A SavedModel contains a complete TensorFlow program, including trained parameters (i.e, tf.Variables) and computation. 
- It does not require the original model building code to run.
- This makes it useful for sharing or deploying with TFLite, TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow Serving, or TensorFlow Hub.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

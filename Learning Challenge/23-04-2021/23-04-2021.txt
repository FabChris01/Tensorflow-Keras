# Learning Updates:
- The tf.distribute APIs provide an easy way for users to scale their training from a single machine to multiple machines. 
- When scaling their model, users also have to distribute their input across multiple devices. 
- tf.distribute provides APIs using which you can automatically distribute your input across devices.
- A callback is a powerful tool to customize the behavior of a Keras model during training, evaluation, or inference. 
- Examples include tf.keras.callbacks.
- TensorBoard to visualize training progress and results with TensorBoard, or tf.keras.callbacks.
- ModelCheckpoint to periodically save your model during training.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

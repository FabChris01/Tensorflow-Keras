# Learning Updates:

- Learnt how to Save a trained model in the HDF5 format
- HDF5 is a format provided by keras for saving models. 
- It is denoted by the extension .5
- I then learnt how to load a saved model and use it for predictions.
- Saving models has multiple advantages like
    = being able to share your model with others
    = Avoiding repetiitive training and,
    = reusing your model for future predictions.
- I also learnt about variables in tensorflow and how to create, update and manage instances of tf.Variable in tensorflow.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

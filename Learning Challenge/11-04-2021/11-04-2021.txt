# Learning Updates:
- TensorFlow Text provides a collection of text related classes and ops ready to use with TensorFlow 2.0. 
- The library can perform the preprocessing regularly required by text-based models.
- It also includes other features useful for sequence modeling not provided by core TensorFlow.
- The benefit of using these ops in your text preprocessing is that they are done in the TensorFlow graph. 
- You do not need to worry about tokenization in training being different than the tokenization at inference, or managing preprocessing scripts.
- TensorFlow implements a subset of the NumPy API, available as tf.experimental.numpy. 
- This allows running NumPy code, accelerated by TensorFlow, while also allowing access to all of TensorFlow's APIs.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

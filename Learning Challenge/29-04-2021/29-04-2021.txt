# Learning Updates:
- GPUs and TPUs can radically reduce the time required to execute a single training step.
- Achieving peak performance requires an efficient input pipeline that delivers data for the next step before the current step has finished. 
- The tf.data API helps to build flexible and efficient input pipelines. 
- Learnt how to use the tf.data API to build highly performant TensorFlow input pipelines.
- Suppose you want to know where an object is located in the image, the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. 
- In this case you will want to segment the image, i.e., each pixel of the image is given a label. 
- Thus, the task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image. 
- This helps in understanding the image at a much lower level, i.e., the pixel level. 
- Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging to name a few.

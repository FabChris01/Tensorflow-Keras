# Learning Updates:
- TensorFlow Cloud is a Python package that provides APIs for a seamless transition from local debugging to distributed training in Google Cloud. 
- It simplifies the process of training TensorFlow models on the cloud into a single, simple function call, requiring minimal setup and no changes to your model. 
- TensorFlow Cloud handles cloud-specific tasks such as creating VM instances and distribution strategies for your models automatically. 
- Also Learnt how to classify images of flowers. 
- We Created an image classifier using a keras.Sequential model
- Then the data was loaded using preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory


# Looking forward to Learning more!

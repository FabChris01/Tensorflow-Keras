Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 12
===============================================

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt about the different methods of data preprocessing.
- Used Keras utilities, layers and other lower-level utilities like tf.data.TextLineDataset to load text files, and tf.text to preprocess the data for finer-grain control.
- Also learnt about Ragged Tensors
- Ragged Tensors are the tensorflow equivalent of nested variable-length lists. They make it easy to store and process data with non-uniform shapes
- These include: 
    = Variable-length features, such as the set of actors in a movie.
    = Batches of variable-length sequential inputs, such as sentences or video clips.
    = Hierarchical inputs, such as text documents that are subdivided into sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words,
    = Individual fields in structured inputs, such as protocol buffers.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

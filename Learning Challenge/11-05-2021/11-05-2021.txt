# Learning Updates:
- tf.estimator is a high-level TensorFlow API. 
- Estimators encapsulate the following actions:
= Training
= Evaluation
= Prediction
= Export for serving
- YAMNet is an audio event classifier that can predict audio events from 521 classes, like laughter, barking, or a siren.
- Learnt how to:
= Load and use the YAMNet model for inference.
= Build a new model using the YAMNet embeddings to classify cat and dog sounds.
= Evaluate and export your model.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

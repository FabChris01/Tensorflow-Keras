# Learning Updates:

- Learnt how to manually upgrade TF1 code to better suit TF2 standards.
- Code upgraded from TF1 to TF2 will only carry the syntactical changes but will not enjoy the improved advancements of TF2.
- In order to take advantage of performance optimizations and simplified API calls, the following changes have to be made:
    = Replace v1.Session.run calls
    = Use Python objects to track variables and losses
    = Upgrade your training loops
    = Upgrade your data input pipelines
    = Migrate off compat.v1 symbols
- Also Learnt how to build a simple text classification model that performs emotion analysis on a IMDB reviews dataset to score each review.
- Performed data preprocessing on the IMDB dataset and split it into training, testing and validation datasets. This data was then fed into the classifier model and trained.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

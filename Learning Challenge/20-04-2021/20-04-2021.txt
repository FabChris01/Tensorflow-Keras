# Learning Updates:
- Learnt multi-worker training with custom training loop API, distributed via MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy, so a Keras model designed to run on single-worker can seamlessly work on multiple workers with minimal code change.
- Used custom training loops to train the model because they give us flexibility and a greater control on training. 
- Moreover, it is easier to debug the model and the training loop.
- Keras provides default training and evaluation loops, fit() and evaluate().
- If you want to customize the learning algorithm of your model while still leveraging the convenience of fit(), you can subclass the Model class and implement your own train_step() method, which is called repeatedly during fit().
- If you want very low-level control over training & evaluation, you should write your own training & evaluation loops from scratch.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

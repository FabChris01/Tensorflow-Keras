# Learning Updates:
- Natural language processing often involves handling different languages and character sets
- To solve this problem, the Unicode encoding system is used.
- Unicode is a standard encoding system used to represent characters from almost all languages
- Each character is encoded using a unique integer code point between 0 and 0x10FFFF. ww
- Unicode string is a sequence of zero or more code points.
- Learnt how to separate Unicode strings into tokens based on script detection.
- When working with tensors that contain a lot of zero values, it is important to store them in a space- and time-efficient manner. 
- Sparse tensors enable efficient storage and processing of tensors that contain a lot of zero values.
- Sparse tensors are used extensively in encoding schemes like TF-IDF as part of data pre-processing in NLP applications and for pre-processing images with a lot of dark pixels in computer vision applications.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

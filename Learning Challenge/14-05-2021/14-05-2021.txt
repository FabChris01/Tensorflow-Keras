# Learning Updates:
- Learnt about time series forecasting using Tensorflow.
- Decision Forests (DF) are a large family of Machine Learning algorithms for supervised classification, regression and ranking.
- As the name suggests, DFs use decision trees as a building block. 
- Today, the two most popular DF training algorithms are Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. 
- Both algorithms are ensemble techniques that use multiple decision trees, but differ on how they do it.
- TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) is a library for the training, evaluation, interpretation and inference of Decision Forest models.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

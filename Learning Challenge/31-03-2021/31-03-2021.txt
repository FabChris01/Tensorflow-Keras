# Learning Updates:

- Learnt how to upgrade TF1 code to TF2 code.
- The tf_upgrade_v2 -h command provides us with multiple functionalities.
- To perform this action, one must have tensorflow 2 installed.
- One can either upgrade multiple files and folders or just upgrade a single file.
- For either case, the upgrade script takes in 3 arguments:
    = the root working directory/ name
    = output file/folder name
    = A text file name
- All the code in the speficied directory gets upgraded to tensorflow 2 and a report of all the conversions gets stored as a text file.

# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to use tf.distribute.Strategy with custom training loops. 
- Trained a simple CNN model on the fashion MNIST dataset. 
- The fashion MNIST dataset contains 60000 train images of size 28 x 28 and 10000 test images of size 28 x 28.
- Used custom training loops to train our model since they give flexibility and a greater control on training. 
- Also, It is easier to debug the model and the training loop.
- The Keras preprocessing layers API allows developers to build Keras-native input processing pipelines. 
- These input processing pipelines can be used as independent preprocessing code in non-Keras workflows, combined directly with Keras models, and exported as part of a Keras SavedModel.
- With Keras preprocessing layers, you can build and export models that are truly end-to-end: models that accept raw images or raw structured data as input; models that handle feature normalization or feature value indexing on their own.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- In TensorFlow 2, eager execution is turned on by default. 
- The user interface is intuitive and flexible (running one-off operations is much easier and faster)
- But this can come at the expense of performance and deployability.
- You can use tf.function to make graphs out of your programs. 
- It is a transformation tool that creates Python-independent dataflow graphs out of your Python code. 
- This will help you create performant and portable models, and it is required to use SavedModel.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 10
===============================================

# Sources:
- https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/numpy
- https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/basic_training_loops


# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to load data from NumPy arrays into a tf.data.Dataset
- Demonstrated how to load a MNISt dataset from a .npz file. 
- The best part of NumPy arrays is that, the source file from which the data in the NumPy array is taken doesn't really matter.
- I applied what i learnt yesterday about tensors, variables, gradient tapes and modules to train models
- Tensorflow contains a high-level neural network API called tf.Keras API
- tf.Keras API provides useful abstractions to reduce boilerplate.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

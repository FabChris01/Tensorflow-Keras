# Learning Updates:
- Offloading computations to GPU might not always be beneficial, particularly for small models. 
- There are overheads due to data transfer between host (CPU) and device (GPU), as well as overheads due to the latency involved when the host launches GPU kernels. 
- Good performance is achieved when the host successfully keeps the GPU occupied by offloading enough work.	
- Learnt about image captioning with an attention-based model.
- It enables us to see what parts of the image the model focuses on as it generates a caption.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- tf.distribute.Strategy is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs.
- Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.
- tf.distribute.Strategy is easy to use, provides good performance out of the box and allows easy switching between strategies
- Learnt how to fine-tune BERT to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of plain-text IMDB movie reviews. 
- Also Learnt how to preprocess text into an appropriate format for training.
- BERT and other Transformer encoder architectures have been wildly successful on a variety of tasks in NLP (natural language processing). 


# Looking forward to Learning more!

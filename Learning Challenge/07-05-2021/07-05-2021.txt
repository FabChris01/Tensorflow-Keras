# Learning Updates:
- Profiling helps you understand the hardware resource consumption (time and memory) of the various TensorFlow operations (ops) in your model 
- It also helps resolve performance bottlenecks and ultimately, make the model execute faster.
- Used the tools available with the Profiler to track the performance of TensorFlow models. 
- This was done to record how the model performs on the host (CPU), the device (GPU), or on a combination of both the host and device(s).
- Also trained a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model for Spanish to English translation.
- After training the model, we were able to input a Spanish sentence, such as "Â¿todavia estan en casa?", and return the English translation: "are you still at home?"	


# Looking forward to Learning more!

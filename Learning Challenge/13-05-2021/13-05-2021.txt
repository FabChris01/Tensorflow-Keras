Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 46
===============================================

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to classify structured data (e.g. tabular data in a CSV).
- Used Keras to define the model, and preprocessing layers as a bridge to map from columns in a CSV to features used to train the model.
- Also Learnt how to classify a highly imbalanced dataset in which the number of examples in one class greatly outnumbers the examples in another.
- Worked with the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset hosted on Kaggle. 
- The aim is to detect a mere 492 fraudulent transactions from 284,807 transactions in total. 


# Looking forward to Learning more!

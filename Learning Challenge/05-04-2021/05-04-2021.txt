# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to load and preprocess an image dataset in three ways. 
- First, using high-level Keras preprocessing utilities and layers to read a directory of images on disk. 
- second, writing your own input pipeline from scratch using tf.data.
- Third, downloading a dataset from the large catalog available in TensorFlow Datasets.
- Built and trained models to demonstrate each.
- Learnt how TensorFlow allows you to make simple changes to your code to get graphs, 
- Also learnt how graphs are stored and represented, and how you can use them to accelerate your models.
- Graphs are data structures that contain a set of tf.Operation objects, which represent units of computation; and tf.Tensor objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. 
- They are defined in a tf.Graph context.
- Since graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates:
- The TFRecord format is a simple format for storing a sequence of binary records.
- Protocol buffers are a cross-platform, cross-language library for efficient serialization of structured data.
- Protocol messages are defined by .proto files
- These are often the easiest way to understand a message type.
- The tf.train.Example message (or protobuf) is a flexible message type that represents a {"string": value} mapping. 
- It is designed for use with TensorFlow and is used throughout the higher-level APIs such as TFX.
- A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

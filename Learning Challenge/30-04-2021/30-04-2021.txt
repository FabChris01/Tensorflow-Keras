Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 33
===============================================

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt to diagnose and fix input pipeline performance issues.
- Trained word embeddings using a simple Keras model for a sentiment classification task.
- Then visualized them in the Embedding Projector.
- Machine learning models take vectors (arrays of numbers) as input. 
- When working with text, the first thing you must do is come up with a strategy to convert strings to numbers (or to "vectorize" the text) before feeding it to the model. 


# Looking forward to Learning more!

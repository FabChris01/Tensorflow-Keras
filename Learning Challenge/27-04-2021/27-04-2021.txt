Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 30
===============================================

# Sources:
- https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/random_numbers
- https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub

# Learning Updates:
- TensorFlow Hub is a repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.
- Learnt how to:
= Use models from TensorFlow Hub with tf.keras
= Use an image classification model from TensorFlow Hub
= Do simple transfer learning to fine-tune a model for your own image classes 
- TensorFlow provides a set of pseudo-random number generators (RNG), in the tf.random module. 
- This document describes how you can control the random number generators, and how these generators interact with other tensorflow sub-systems.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

Tensorflow and Keras Learning Challenge Day 29

# Learning Updates:
- Learnt how to classify images of cats and dogs by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network.
- A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. 
- In transfer learning, you either use the pretrained model as is or use transfer learning to customize this model to a given task.
- Learnt how to create a custom C++ op. 
- There are several reasons why you might want to create a custom C++ op:
= It's not easy or possible to express your operation as a composition of existing ops.
= It's not efficient to express your operation as a composition of existing primitives.
= You want to hand-fuse a composition of primitives that a future compiler would find difficult fusing.

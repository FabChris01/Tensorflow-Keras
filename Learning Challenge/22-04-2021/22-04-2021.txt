# Learning Updates:
- Masking is a way to tell sequence-processing layers that certain timesteps in an input are missing
- Thus it should be skipped when processing the data.
- Padding is a special form of masking where the masked steps are at the start or the end of a sequence. 
- Padding comes from the need to encode sequence data into contiguous batches: in order to make all sequences in a batch fit a given standard length, it is necessary to pad or truncate some sequences.
- It's common to save and load a model during training. There are two sets of APIs for saving and loading a keras model: a high-level API, and a low-level API.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

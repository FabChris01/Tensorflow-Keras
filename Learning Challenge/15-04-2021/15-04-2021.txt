# Learning Updates:
- Most of the time when writing code for machine learning models you want to operate at a higher level of abstraction than individual operations and manipulation of individual variables.
- TensorFlow includes the full Keras API in the tf.keras package.
- The Keras layers are very useful when building your own models.
- Model training & evaluation works strictly in the same way across every kind of Keras model.
- Sequential models, models built with the Functional API, and models written from scratch via model subclassing.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Learning Updates

- Learnt to build and train a sequential model to predict the average age group of people who get the most side effects from vaccine.
- Looked into Linear Regression and best fit techniques.
- Learnt the math behind tensors and linear Regression using graphs.

- Tensors - n dimensional vector values stored in matrix format.
- Rank/Degree of a tensor - The deepest level of a nested list in a tensor.

- tf.rank - used to determine the rank of a tensor.
- tf.shape - gives the shape of the tensor, i.e., the number of rows and columns.


# Looking forward to Learning more!

# Updates

- Tensorflow and Keras are Machine Learning Libraries to facilitate easy and fast user implementation of complex tasks in the machine learning process.
- Keras is officially associated with Tensorflow which is owned by Google.
- In Data Processing, "Samples" refer to input/input data while "Labels" refer to target/goal data.
- Sequential Models receive data for training whenever the fit function is called.
- The fit function takes arguments like x and y, where x is the train data and y is the test data. i.e., x is the input and y is the target.
- Machine Learning has three broad classifications:
        = Supervised Learning,
        = Unsupervised Learning,
        = Reinforcement Learning.

= Supervised Learning: 
        - The user gives the input and the desired target output classification in terms of samples and labels.

= Unsupervised Learning:
        - The user gives only the input data. The model learns by classifying the data together into clusters based on similarities.

= Reinforcement Learning:
        - This type of Learning is based on an agent-environment-reward loop based technique.
